Assignment1: 
In this assignment, I am implementing a Random Forest, using the files provided, without using any third-party library except NumPy and pandas. You will then apply your Random Forest to classify people into those who earn less than 50k and higher than 50k based on their features. The given dataset consists of 14 features (6 continuous and 8 categorical).

Assignment2: 
The aim of this assignment is to implement K-Means, which is a representation-based clustering algorithm, using the Python programming language, and to test it on a single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset.
